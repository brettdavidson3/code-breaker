Code Breaker
============

A frantic word completion game!

## Playing the game

Code Breaker is not quite ready for you to play it yet.  Please check back soon for an alpha version of the game!

## Development

Code Breaker is written in Java 8 and relies on the [libgdx framework](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
Currently, **only the Desktop version of the game is supported**.

### Install Java 8 SE

To begin development you must first install Java 8 SE.  You can download and install it at [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=ocomen).

### Choose your development environment

Libgdx is designed to work via the command line or in your favorite IDE.  Development in IntelliJ is recommended as
most work to this date has been done in that environment.  If you choose another development environment you may have to iron
out some additional configuration details.

#### IntelliJ Setup

* Follow the instructions for importing a project [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Intellij-IDEA#importing-your-project).
* Set up the run configuration for the **Desktop** according to that [same page](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Intellij-IDEA#running-your-project).
* Test out your run configuration by hitting the play button.
* Depending on your environment, you may have to increase the language level setting for your IntelliJ project.
  * Click File -> Project Structure -> Project and set the Project Language Level to 8
  
#### Other development environments

You can refer to the Libgdx [Getting Started](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx#getting-started) guide to set up Code Breaker for other environments.
**Warning**: you may have to sort out additional configuration details on your own.
